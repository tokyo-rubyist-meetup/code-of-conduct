# Code of Conduct for Tokyo Rubyist Meetup

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

Tokyo Rubyist Meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 

We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a organizer immediately. Alternatively, you may contact us via [our contact page](https://trbmeetup.doorkeeper.jp/contact/new).
